## Hi folks👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my research project aimed to help me to get my bachelors degree (Can you pray by me? I'd Really appreciate it.)

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, C, Scrum and Machine learning with Python. Being honest, I'm an entry-level developer, but I'm motivated. Lately change my OS, now I'm falling in love with Ubuntu.
